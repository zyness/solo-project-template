# Project Initiation Guide

## Purpose
Define the initial steps to validate the idea, define the scope, and ensure the project is feasible before writing code.

## When to use
Whenever a new project idea or a significant new feature module is being considered.

## Goals
- **Why:** Confirm the value (learning, problem-solving, or commercial).
- **Who:** Define the Target Audience (even if it's just you).
- **How:** Select the Tech Stack and tools.
- **Go/No-Go:** Decide if this fits into your current time budget.

## Minimum Deliverables
- Project One-pager (Problem, Goal, Tech Stack)
- High-level timeline (Timeboxing)
- Rough effort estimate (Hours/Days)

## Project One-pager Template
- **Project name:**
- **Problem statement:** (What hurts? Why build this?)
- **Objective / Goal (SMART):** (e.g., "Learn React" or "Automate my taxes")
- **Target Audience:** (Me, Open Source Community, Customers)
- **Success metrics:** (How do I know I am finished?)
- **Tech Stack & Tools:** (Languages, Frameworks, Hosting)
- **Quick risks:** (e.g., "I don't know this API yet", "Hosting costs money")

## Initiation Checklist
- [ ] One-pager completed.
- [ ] **Sanity Check:** Slept on the idea for 24h to ensure it's not just "Shiny Object Syndrome".
- [ ] **Tech Feasibility:** Checked if required APIs/Libraries actually exist.
- [ ] Create repo and initial folder structure.
- [ ] Add initial artifacts to `docs/` or `.copilot/`.

## Decision Gate
Start Planning/Coding when:
- You know **what** "Done" looks like (Success metrics).
- You have chosen the **tools** (Tech Stack).
- You realistically have the **time** to finish the MVP.
